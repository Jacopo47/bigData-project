# bigData-project

This project is for the final exam of the course of Big Data 2019/2020. 
The goal of the project is to create two jobs (1 MapReduce / 1 Spark) on an Hadoop cluster.

## Dataset

The dataset is illustrated [here](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays).

## Jobs

Both the jobs are based on the same query: 

 * Rank of the best airlines based on a KPI obtained with a relationship between total flights's delay minutes and distance in KM (total delay minutes / distance KM)
